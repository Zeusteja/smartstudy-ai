1. Water is H₂O
2. Table salt is NaCl
3. Atomic number = Number of protons
4. Mass number = Protons + Neutrons
5. Isotopes: Atoms with same protons but different neutrons
6. Avogadro’s Number = 6.022 × 10²³
7. 1 mole = 6.022 × 10²³ particles
8. pH < 7 is acidic, pH > 7 is basic
9. Acid + Base = Salt + Water
10. Law of Conservation of Mass: Mass is neither created nor destroyed
11. Balancing equations conserves atoms
12. HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O
13. Noble gases are inert
14. Covalent bond: shared electrons
15. Ionic bond: transfer of electrons
16. Electronegativity: tendency to attract electrons
17. Periods are rows, Groups are columns in periodic table
18. Transition metals lie in groups 3–12
19. Atomic radius decreases across a period
20. Ionization energy increases across a period
21. Catalyst: speeds up reaction without being consumed
22. Oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction is gain
23. Redox reactions involve transfer of electrons
24. Alkanes: single bonds (CnH2n+2)
25. Alkenes: one double bond (CnH2n)
26. Alcohols have -OH group
27. Esters smell fruity
28. Greenhouse gases: CO₂, CH₄
29. Electrolysis splits water into H₂ and O₂
30. Haber process: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃
